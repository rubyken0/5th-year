# ============================================================

# Q1. What is Python and why is it useful to learn?
# Your answer: Python is a programming language and is very useful because it is easy to read and use. its useful for games,web design and more.

# Q2. What is an IDE? Give one example.
# Your answer: Integrated Development Environment — software that helps you write/run/debug code.
#     Examples: Thonny, PyCharm, VS Code, IDLE.

# Q3. Which data type is each of the following?
#   a) 42 - int
#   b) "42" string
#   c) 3.14 float
#   d) True bool
#   e) [1, 2, 3] list
# Your answer:

# Q4. What does type casting mean? Show how to convert "42" into an integer.
# Your answer: type casting means converting a value from one type to another. to convert '42' (a string) into an integer you do this, for example by:
#str='42'
#num=int(str)
#print(num)
#
#

# Q5. Explain the difference between = and == in Python.
# Your answer: '==' is for comparing two values for equality,'='assignign value to variable

# Q6. How does range(start, stop) work in a for loop? Which value is excluded?
# Your answer: includes from start and goes up to stop but does not include stop eg (2,5) from 2 up to but not including 5

# Q7. What is an off-by-one error? Give a short example.
# Your answer: when loop runs one too many or too few times because of user error

# Q8. word = "hello"; print(word[1:4])  
# What will this output, and why?
# Your answer:ell

# Q9. Lists are mutable. What does that mean?
# Your answer: changeable (in place)

# B1) Input and numbers
#print("\nB1) Input and numbers")
# Broken:
#a = int(input("Enter a number: "))
#b = int(input("Enter another number: "))
#sum=a+b
#print("Sum is", sum)
# Task: Fix so numbers are added correctly, not joined as text.

# Write your fix here:


# B2) Conditional check
#print("\nB2) Conditional check")
# Broken:
#x = 10
#if x == 10:
#    print("Ten")
# Task: Use the correct comparison operator.

# Write your fix here:


# B3) While loop increment
#print("\nB3) While loop increment")
# Broken:
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count,end=' ')
    count+=1

# Task: Fix so it prints 1..5 and then stops.

if friendNames>0:                                   #if user has more than 0 friends following condtions will happen 
    for f in range(friendNames):                     #basically until amount of friends it will stop
        name=input('enter friends name: ')          #getting user to enter names, above makes so keeps asking for amount of freinds
        friendList.append(name)                      #create lsit append, adds names to said list
    print('the names of your friends are:',friendList)

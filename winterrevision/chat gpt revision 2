#this program allows the user to order pizza, calculates the total cost, asks the user for any add-ons and prints total prints change/amount owed
#1  printing a welcome message
print('Welcome to RUBYS pizza service!')
#2  making a variable for how much the pizzas cost and an empty one for the total cost which is epmty as it will be changed later in the code
pizza_cost=9
total_cost=0
#3  making a variable, using input statment so the user can reply with their name and capitalizing said response 
u_name=input('Enter your name: ').capitalize()
print(f'Order handled by: {u_name}')
#4  using a while loop to ask the user how many pizzas they are ordering and loop until the user enters a valid number and if they do the loop breaks
while True:
    pizza=int(input('How many pizzas are you ordering?  '))
    if pizza<=0:
        print('Invalid number entered')
    else:
        break
#5  using a for loop to loop for however amount they entered of pizza to calculate the total cost and add and assign the price for each time
for i in range(1,pizza+1):
    total_cost+=pizza_cost
#6 creating a variable and using input statment so user can enter reply and using conditional statement to do something based on what the user entered and adding the price to the total cost
garlic_bread=input('\nWould you like garlic bread for €3? y/n: ')
if garlic_bread=='y':
    total_cost+=3
else:
    print('Okay!')
#7
drink=input('Would you like a soft drink for €1.50? y/n: ')
if drink=='y':
    total_cost+=1.5
else:
    print('Okay!')
#8 printing the total cost rounded to 2 decimals
print(f'\nThe total cost is €{round(total_cost,2)}')
#9  asking how much the user is paying using input statement, using conditional statement to compare what they answered with the total cost to see if its more or less, then printing their change/amount owed
pays=float(input('\nHow much are you paying?  '))
if pays>=total_cost:
    change=pays-total_cost
    print(f'\nThank you, change: €{round(change,2)}')
else:
    owe=total_cost-pays
    print(f'\nPayment unsuccessful, still owe: €{round(owe,2)}')

#2 using input statement to ask user what their name is
name=input('\nEnter your name: ').strip().capitalize()
#3  using if statement to check if the variabke name is in members list

#4  using if statement checking if they are not in the list then asking if they want to register and adding their name to the list, if no code ends

#9 printing sorted list above ^

#5 and 6  using while loop to ask how mant games they want and asking until they enter a valid number using the while loop
        
while True:
    video_game=int(input('\nHow many games do you want to rent (€4)?  '))
    if video_game<=0:
        print('Invalid')

#8  using for loop to add the game price for every 'game' amount stated in the variable video_game
for i in range(1,video_game+1):
    total_cost+=game_price
#9 printing the rounded total
print(f'\nThe total cost is : €{round(total_cost,2)}')
